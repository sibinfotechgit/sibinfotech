                                We normally ask for CLIENT credit card or payment info so that we can charge the CLIENTS card for services provided OR we may also send an invoice so that you can pay from your end. Claiming that you didn’t provide your card info or that you are not aware of such charges is illegal and fraudulent.</p>
                            <p>
                                If any chargeback or payment dispute is caused by CLIENT to a bank or credit card company, then CLIENT services and/or projects will be suspended and in some cases all work will be undone (reversed) without notice. Furthermore, the amount of the chargeback fee will be issued to CLIENT (to recover any fees passed on to us by the credit card company).</p>
                            <p>
                                In Addition, any outstanding balances accrued as a result of the chargeback(s) will have to be paid in full before we restore service, deliver any files, or commence any work.</p>
